# HTML and CSS News for February 2017

- [HTML & CSS-related updates for developers in Opera 43](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-43/)
    - Prerender from address bar
        - Opera will now prerender pages that are typed into the address bar, before the user hits enter, which can make the page finish loading much sooner.
    - Opera now supports `position: sticky`, a new way to position elements. A position: sticky element is relatively-positioned, but becomes `position: fixed` after the user reaches a certain scroll position. This results in smoother scroll without jumps compared to trying to achieve the same thing with scroll events and JavaScript. For more info see [this article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/position-sticky) by Paul Kinlan.
    - The new generic font family `system-ui` is now supported, which matches the platformâ€™s default UI font.
    - `touch-action: pinch-zoom` is now supported.
    - Non-whitespace Unicode control characters will now be rendered according to the specification, rather than being ignored.
