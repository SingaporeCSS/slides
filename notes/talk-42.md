# HTML and CSS News for August 2019

## Browser updates

- [HTML & CSS-related updates for developers in Firefox 68](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/68)
    + A button has been added to the rules panel of the Page inspector that allows you to toggle the display of any print media queries (bug 1534984).
    + The fonts panel now includes a slider to modify letter-spacing (bug 1536237).
    + A warning icon appears next to unsupported CSS properties or rules that have invalid values, to help you understand why certain styles are not being applied (bug 1306054).
    + CSS Scroll Snapping has been updated to the latest version of the specification (bug 1312163) and (bug 1544136)
    + The `-webkit-line-clamp` property has been implemented for compatibility with other browsers (bug 866102).
    + Support has been added for the `::marker` pseudo-element (bug 205202) and animation for `::marker` pseudos (bug 1538618)
    + We changed `currentcolor` to be a computed value (except for the `color` property)  (bug 760345).
    + Support has been fixed for the `ch` length unit so it now matches the spec (fallback for no '0' glyph, vertical metrics) (bug 282126)
    + The  `counter-set` property has been implemented. (bug 1518201).
    + Selector matching and parsing support has been implemented for `::part()` (bug 1545430) and (bug 1545425).
    + CSS Transforms are now supported in indirectly rendered things e.g.)  `<mask>`,  `<marker>`, `<pattern>`, `<clipPath>` (bug 1323962).
    + While we're keeping the prefixed versions of the various gradient properties (`linear-gradient()`, `radial-gradient()`, and `repeating-radial-gradient()` available for compatibility reasons, we have revised how they're parsed so that they're handled much more like the non-prefixed versions. This means that certain existing styles won't work correctly.
