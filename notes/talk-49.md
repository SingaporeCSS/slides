Kersey states that every element of the release will be abandoned with plans to skip to Chrome 83 (M83) at some point in the future: 
        - We will abandon current M82 branches, remove infra support, and stop testing/merges to the branches
        - We will not push any new M82 releases to Dev, and we will stop stabilization for Beta.
        - We will move Dev channel to M83 asap
        - We will keep Beta channel on M81 until M83 is ready to be promoted
