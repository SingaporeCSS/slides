# HTML and CSS News for October 2019

## Browser updates

- [HTML & CSS-related updates for developers in Firefox 70](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/70)
    + Firefox can now suggest securely-generated passwords to the user in the following situations:
        - An `<input>` element has the `autocomplete="new-password"` attribute value.
        - The user opens the context menu on any password input element, even if it is not intended for new passwords.
    + Opacity values like for `opacity` or `stop-opacity` can now be percentages (bug 1562086).
    + `grid-auto-columns` and `grid-auto-rows` now accept multiple track-size values (bug 1339672).
    + A number of text-related CSS properties have been enabled by default (bug 1573631):
        - `text-decoration-thickness`
        - `text-underline-offset`
        - `text-decoration-skip-ink`, the default value is auto, which means that by default underlines and overlines are now interrupted where they would otherwise cross over a glyph.
    + The `display` property now accepts two keyword values representing the inner and outer display type (bug 1038294, bug 1105868 and bug 1557825).
    + The `font-size` property now accepts the new keyword value `xxx-large`. (bug 1553545).
    The `:visite`d pseudo-class no longer matches `<link>` elements, for logic and performance reasons.
    + We now support an `auto` value for the `quotes` property (bug 1421938).
    + Stylesheets contained in `<style>` elements are now cached for reuse, to improve performance (bug 1480146). Note that this currently doesn't include stylesheets that contain `@import` rules.
    + The `<ratio>` type now accepts `<number>/<number>` or a single `<number>` as a value. (bug 1565562).
