# HTML and CSS News for November 2020

## Browser updates

- [HTML & CSS-related updates for developers in Firefox 82](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/82)
    - The color picker used for `<input type="color">` is now keyboard-accessible on Windows
    - The allow-downloads flag for the `<iframe sandbox>` attribute is now supported
    - Support for the new ::file-selector-button pseudo-element has been added. This pseudo-element represents the file selection button inside an `<input type="file">` element
    - We have improved error recovery for the `:is()` and `:where()` pseudo-classes. These pseudo-classes now accept a forgiving selector list, where an invalid selector in the list will not render the entire list invalid
    - `appearance: button` now applies only to buttons; the button value of  appearance will otherwise behave as auto
